# The Pear Driver

We have made a useless screwdriver, known as the Pear Driver. This is a play on Apple, whose products are widely regarded as badly designed and inefficient.

Please check the renders file for some of the renders we haven't used in the "website" (hopefully it works, it wasn't hosted anywhere)

features
- twists at the handle so that when you try to screw something... it does nothing
- the screw head is also like apple; its not flathead or Phillips, its custom
- comes in multiple colours - white & black
